Description: reimplement the joe Debian package using jupp
 This package contains symbolic links to replace the Debian joe package
 using the jupp package and implementation (both binaries and manpages).
 It also contains the appropriate conffiles and, in contrast to Debian's
 joe flavour, supports SELinux context copying (on Debian systems with
 the Linux kernel), and has many bugs fixed and makes some of jupps new
 features available to the joe, jstar, jmacs, jpico and rjoe flavours.

Description: user friendly full screen text editor
 Joe, the Joe's Own Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors: the key
 sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors, but the feature
 set is much larger than of those.  Joe has all of the features a Unix
 user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix
 integration, a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search
 system.  It also has eight help reference cards which are always available,
 and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface.
 .
 Joe has a great screen update optimisation algorithm, multiple windows
 (through/between which you can scroll) and lacks the confusing notion of
 named buffers.  It has command history, TAB expansion in file selection
 menus, undo and redo functions, (un)indenting and paragraph formatting,
 filtering highlighted blocks through any external Unix command, editing
 a pipe into or out of a command, block move, copy, delete or filter, a
 bracketed paste mode automatically enabled on xterm-xfree86 and decimal
 and hexadecimal gotos for lines, columns, and file offsets.
 .
 Through simple QEdit-style configuration files, Joe can be set up to
 emulate editors such as Pico and Emacs, along with a complete imitation
 of WordStar in non-document mode, and a restricted mode version (lets you
 edit only the files specified on the command line). Joe also has a deferred
 screen update to handle typeahead, and it ensures that deferral is not
 bypassed by tty buffering. It's usable even at 2400 baud, and it will work
 on any kind of sane terminal. Furthermore, it supports SELinux context
 copying on Debian systems with the Linux kernel.
 .
 This version of JOE only comes with the Jupp flavour, to not conflict
 with the Debian joe package, activated. The resource files and executable
 links and menu entries for the other flavours are still available, though,
 in the joe-jupp package.

Description: YAML network configuration abstraction runtime library
 netplan reads YAML network configuration files which are written
 by administrators, installers, cloud image instantiations, or other OS
 deployments. During early boot it then generates backend specific
 configuration files in /run to hand off control of devices to a particular
 networking daemon.
 .
 Currently supported backends are networkd and NetworkManager.
 .
 This package contains the necessary runtime library files.

Description: Log rotation utility
 The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
 log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  Logrotate
 allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
 log files.  Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
 monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.  Normally, logrotate
 runs as a daily cron job.
